Charades App!
the app i've created for the first coding assignment is a very simple one activity app, upon clicking the button it generates a random number which is then passed into a onclick event to display a different element of an array each time the button is pressed. My main issue with this app was having a random crash seemingly ever 10 or so clicks on the button, but after testing and looking through the code i had realized that i forgot to subtract one from my array length variable. Aside from that the app now runs bug free!
